Pyber Ride Sharing Analysis
1.	Urban cities had the largest percentage of total rides, fare and drivers.
The more densely populated an area is, the more likely drivers and riders are to find themselves near each other, so riders get picked up faster and drivers donâ€™t have to drive as far.
2.	Urban cities had the lowest average fare ($24.52), It is possible that there is an over supply of drivers in these cities causing lower prices.
3.	Even though rural cities had the highest average fare ($34.62), the rural cities had the smallest segment of the total fares 4327.93.
From this analysis can be predicted that there are many new opportunities to expand the business in suburban and rural cities, hiring more drivers will provide new ways for residents to get around by lowering the fare cost.
